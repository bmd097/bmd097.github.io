# 📊 Pressure-Is-the-Only-Honest-Metric - Measure Pressure, Understand Systems

## 🌐 About the Application

The "Pressure-Is-the-Only-Honest-Metric" application presents a long-form systems essay. It argues that traditional metrics often fail because they focus on outcomes instead of the underlying pressure that leads to those outcomes. By examining buffer depletion, debt accumulation, and delayed feedback, this work offers insights into why measuring pressure is vital for early warnings in complex systems.
